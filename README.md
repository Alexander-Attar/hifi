HiFi
====

An Audiovisual radio powered by SoundCloud and Tumblr.
Visit HiFi online [here.](http://hifi.herokuapp.com/)

Plug HiFi into some speakers and a projector at a venue or at your next party and let the tunes and imagery unfold.

HiFi lets you select a radio of your own SoundCloud sounds, your favorite sounds, or a genre of your choice.
New images are collected from Tumblr daily so that the visual content will continue to evolve.
